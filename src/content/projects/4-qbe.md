For this project, I designed a set of marketing materials including banners, flyers, and posters for an insurance company. Each piece was meticulously crafted to emphasize crucial information such as the cost and benefits of the insurance plans offered. The designs were created to be visually appealing and informative, ensuring that potential customers could easily understand the value and options available to them.

Additionally, the project involved co-branding with partner companies, requiring a seamless blend of both brands while maintaining the aesthetics of each. Consistent use of brand colors, fonts, and logos ensured that all marketing pieces aligned with the companyâ€™s established identity. The result was a cohesive set of marketing materials that effectively communicated the company's offerings while reinforcing its brand image and harmoniously integrating the partner brands.
