For this project, I designed a series of elegant menus for the Intercontinental Hotel's special occasion brunches, including Mother's Day, Father's Day, Easter, and more. Each menu reflected the hotel's sophisticated branding, ensuring a luxurious dining experience. High-quality images, refined typography, and a tasteful color palette were used to create a cohesive and elegant look, tailored to each specific occasion.

The final designs not only enhanced the dining experience but also reinforced the Intercontinental Hotel's reputation for excellence and attention to detail. The menus were both functional and aesthetically pleasing, seamlessly blending with the hotel's upscale ambiance and providing guests with a memorable dining experience.
