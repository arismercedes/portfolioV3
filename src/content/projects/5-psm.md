For this project, I created a marketing campaign for a healthcare company aimed at promoting their healthcare plans. The primary goal was to craft a look that was approachable and friendly to the customer. This was achieved through the use of warm, inviting imagery and a cool blend of colors that conveyed a sense of trust and comfort.

The campaign focused on clear, concise information about the healthcare plans, highlighting the benefits and coverage options available. By using relatable visuals and a welcoming color palette, the marketing materials effectively communicated the company's commitment to customer care and wellbeing. The end result was a cohesive and appealing campaign that not only promoted the healthcare plans but also reinforced the company's image as a caring and reliable provider.
