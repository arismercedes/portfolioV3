King Street Pantry is a nose-to-tail butcher and grocer in St. Catharines that focuses on ethically farmed meat and produce. The logo features knives, symbolizing precision and honesty, as well as a crown representing sustainable farming. The typeface is incised serif, inspired by traditional British butcher shops, and complemented by a geometric sans-serif font from the same era. The brand identity represents the business' values and expertise, with a nod to its location, and an inviting, familiar aesthetic conveying transparency and trust.
