For this project, I designed a series of engaging email templates and a comprehensive booklet aimed at recruiting new insurance agents. The email series included custom templates optimized for all devices, maintaining brand consistency and adhering to industry standards.

The booklet was designed with high-resolution images and a clear, readable layout. Both the emails and the booklet highlighted the benefits of joining the insurance company, with a strong focus on the unique opportunities and support provided to agents. The cohesive design across all materials ensured a professional and compelling recruitment campaign.
