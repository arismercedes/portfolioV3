This project involved creating a modern, visually appealing presentation aimed at recruiting new agents. The presentation was designed with a sleek, contemporary look, utilizing vibrant colors to engage and inform potential recruits.

In addition to the presentation, I developed a series of social media pieces to promote the recruitment conference. These social media graphics were consistent with the presentation's aesthetic, ensuring a cohesive look across all promotional materials. The campaign effectively highlighted the benefits of joining the company and generated interest and attendance for the recruitment event.
